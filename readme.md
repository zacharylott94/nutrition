# Nutricalc

A CSV-driven, locally hosted, nutrition repository and macronutrient calculator for the terminal.

## Scope

This software is intended for people who only need to keep track of a handful of food items, portion their food by weight (grams specifically), only care about macronutrients and calorie counts, and don't want to be bogged down by menus.

## use

`nut <food> <grams>` -> `<kcal> <protein> <fat> <carbs>`
